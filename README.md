# 🎬 My Movie Tracker

This is a personal log of all the movies, series, anime, and dramas I’ve watched and finished. I update it daily using Google Sheets!

The spreadsheet includes:
- Title
- Genre
- Type (Movie / Series / Anime / Drama)
- Rating (my personal rating)
- Notes or Thoughts

## ✨ Why I Do This
Tracking what I watch helps me:
- Reflect on what I’ve consumed
- Understand my evolving taste
- Practice organizing and cleaning personal data (useful for future data analysis!)

## 📓 For Journaling & Reflection
Beyond data, this project also serves as:
- A personal journal of stories I’ve experienced through screens
- A reflection of emotions, lessons, and insights from various shows and films
- A documentation of my media habits and how they change over time

## 🔮 What's Next?
Later on, I might:
- Export the data for analysis (using Python or SQL)
- Visualize trends in my watching habits
- Build a personal movie dashboard or recommendation engine
